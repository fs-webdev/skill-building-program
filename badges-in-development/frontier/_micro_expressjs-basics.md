> ExpressJS: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js

Express.js is a Node.js framework. It handles routing, middleware, etc. It has very widespread adoption in the industry, and works really well. It has a clean & minimalist API and enables us to get a lot of work done very quickly. It also has pretty clear docs, once you grasp the underlying principles.
