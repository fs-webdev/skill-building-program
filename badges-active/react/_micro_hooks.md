# React - Hooks & State Management [Micro Badge]

-----

Est. to complete: 6hr

## Goals
- You have demonstrated foundational knowledge in hooks and state management.
- You should have some experience working with React hooks, contexts, and reducers, as well as creating your own hooks.

-----

## Intro

>React Hooks enable us to write React applications with only function components.
> (Robin Wieruch)[https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks]

React Hooks add state management to function components, making it possible to use all of the
benefits of JavaScript functions when writing components.  Because hooks are the basis of Frontier React components, 
it's important to know the ins and outs of React Hooks.

## Suggested Assignment(s)

1) Make a creative project that demonstrates the following:
- [ ] use `useState` - including setting state from a click handler
- [ ] use `useEffect` - including cleanup and setting state from a network call
- [ ] use `useReducer` - create a reducer to handle multiple state changes
- [ ] use `useCallback` - make a component more stable with effective use of useCallback
- [ ] use `useMemo` - wrap an expensive operation in useMemo for performance
- [ ] use `useContext` - wrap multiple components in a context and use that context to simplify the components' APIs 
- [ ] write and use a custom hook 


2) Demonstrate how you've done nearly all of #1 in your work or side-work

3) Something else creative that proves you are totally legit in this topic
