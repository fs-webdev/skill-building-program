# React - Unit Testing [Micro Badge]

-----

Est. to complete: 4hr

## Goals
- You have demonstrated foundational knowledge in React Unit Testing.
- You should have some experience working with renders, waits, finds, and expects.

-----

## Intro

> You can test React components similar to testing other JavaScript code.

Testing React components ensures your code will run as intended and be easy to refactor in the future 
while preventing the same problems from creeping back into the code.

-----

## Suggested Assignment(s)

1) Make a creative project that demonstrates the following:
- [ ] Render a component and find contents
- [ ] Use `getByLabelText()` in a test and describe the purpose of using such queries.
- [ ] Use `waitFor()` in a test and describe its purpose.
- [ ] Test a form by mimicking user interaction and form submission and then test the component's response 
- [ ] Explain why we get `act()` warnings and describe 2 ways to mitigate them.
- [ ] Use `findBy*()` and `getBy*()` functions in tests and explain the difference between `find` and `get`.
- [ ] Use async/await in a test function
- [ ] Mock a network call made in code and test both the error and success cases
- [ ] Mock a `window` function, such as `scrollTo()`

2) Demonstrate how you've done nearly all of #1 in your work or side-work

3) Something else creative that proves you are totally legit in this topic
