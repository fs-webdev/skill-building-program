# React - Performance [Micro Badge]

-----

Est. to complete: 1hr

## Goals
- You have demonstrated foundational knowledge in React Performance
- You should have some experience working with profilers, measuring performance, and improving performance in a React app.

-----

## Intro

>Internally, React uses several clever techniques to minimize the number of costly DOM operations required to 
>update the UI. For many applications, using React will lead to a fast user interface without doing much work to 
>specifically optimize for performance. Nevertheless, there are several ways you can speed up your React application.

Our apps are used by people all over the world, with varying levels of connections and devices.  
It is important to: a) know how our apps perform and b) have our apps perform well in most situations.
