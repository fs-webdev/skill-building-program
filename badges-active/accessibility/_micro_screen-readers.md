Accessibility - Screen Readers [Micro Badge]
===================================================

Est. time to complete:

Goals:
------

- You have demonstrated how to use a screen reader to navigate a web site


Intro
-----

> A screen reader enables blind and vision impaired people to use computers. It reads the text on the screen in a computerised voice. You can control what is read to you by moving the cursor to the relevant area of text with a mouse or the arrows on your keyboard.

Screen readers are used by users who are blind, have low vision, are illiterate, or have learning disabilities. Since screen readers read pages differently, it's best to test features using multiple screen readers for maximum compatibility.

Suggested Assignment(s)
---------------------

Choose one:

1) Choose a screen reader (either from the ones listed below or one of your choosing) and learn to navigate a web site using it, and demonstrate and discuss your findings
