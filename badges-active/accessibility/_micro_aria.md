Accessibility - ARIA [Micro Badge]
===================================================

Est. time to complete: 2-3h

Goals:
------

- You have demonstrated the basic foundations of ARIA
- You should have some experience using ARIA and understand when and when not to use it.


Intro
-----

> First Rule of ARIA Use: If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so. – [Using ARIA - W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1)

> ARIA isn't for making HTML accessible. It's for making inaccessible HTML accessible. – Heydon Pickering

> ARIA has its purposes which in most cases is to extend HTML and fill in where it comes short. It’s not meant as a hack. – Sara Soueidan‏

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a way to programmatically make HTML accessible. It should be used as a last resort when no other native HTML element or pattern solves the problem in a more accessible way. Knowing when not to use ARIA is just as important as knowing when to use it.
