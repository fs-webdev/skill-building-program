Accessibility - Assistive Technology [Micro Badge]
===================================================

Est. time to complete: 1h

Goals:
------

- Understand that a disability is not a limitation, and that assistive technology brings freedom and autonomy.
- Understand the needs of people with disabilities (PWD), what problems they face, and the wide array of assistive technology they use.


Intro
-----

> Assistive technology is any device that helps a person with a disability complete an everyday task. If you break your leg, a remote control for the TV can be assistive technology. If someone has poor eyesight, a pair of glasses or a magnifier is assistive technology. Assistive technology includes many specialized devices as well, like typing telephones for people who are deaf and motorized wheelchairs for people who cannot walk. Assistive technology can be “low-tech” (something very simple and low-cost, like a pencil grip), or “high-tech” (something sophisticated, like a computer). Assistive technology can be critical for the person using it – if you wear glasses, think how hard it would be to get through the day without them! – [PBS.org Education - Assistive Technology](http://www.pbs.org/parents/education/learning-disabilities/strategies-for-learning-disabilities/assistive-technology/)

By learning about how different assistive technologies help users perform every day tasks, we can begin to understand that the web, in and of itself, is an assistive technology. By making websites accessible, we bring freedom and autonomy to our users.
