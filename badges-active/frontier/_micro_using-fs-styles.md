# Frontier - Using FS Styles [Micro Badge]

## Goals:

* You have demonstrated what styles and helpers are available in FS Styles, and how to use some of them
* You should be aware of the general principles behind what gets included in FS Styles

## Intro

> [...] many different designers and front-end developers had come and gone, each appending a new portion to the sprawling application. By the time I arrived, the CSS was huge, the styles were varied, and it took a lot of effort to find out if anything was reusable.

* [A List Apart - Creating Style Guides](http://alistapart.com/article/creating-style-guides)

As our webdev and UX teams grow and change over time, a style guide can help us maintain brand consistency and build things faster, since modules and styles have been pre-defined. Using a living style guide is more like assembling Legos than building a house from scratch. In addition to boosting dev productivity, it also has web performance benefits. When more of our webapps use fs-styles' code, the user's browser will pull fs-styles from cache more often than each app's custom code could.

## Suggested Assignment(s)

Choose one:

1. In a Frontier App, turn this awesome "Roundhouse Kick Widget" mockup into a webpage using only FS-styles and a tiny bit of JavaScript to switch classes and iterate a counter. No custom CSS or inline styles allowed, not even via JavaScript. [(Video of mockup)](../../img/norris-kick-fs-styles.mp4) Extra points for creativity, extra functionality, or for exclusively using VanillaJS for functionality.

2. Demonstrate how you've used several parts of FS-Styles in your daily work
