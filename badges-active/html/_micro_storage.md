HTML - Storage [Micro Badge]
=================================================

Est. to complete: ~2h


Goals:
------

- You have demonstrated the basic foundational knowledge in HTML5 Storage.
- You should have some experience using HTML5 Web Storage such as localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB, and File and FileReader API's.


Intro
-----

> When web developers think of storing anything about the user, they immediately think of uploading to the server. HTML5 changes that, as there are now several technologies allowing the app to save data on the client device. It might also be sync'd back to the server, or it might only ever stay on the client: that's down to you, the developer. - [HTML5 Features: Storage - HTML5 Rocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/storage)
