## Intro

> The control which designers know in the print medium, and often desire in the 
web medium, is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page. We 
should embrace the fact that the web doesn’t have the same constraints, and 
design for this flexibility. But first, we must 'accept the ebb and flow of 
things.' - John Allsopp, "A Dao of Web Design"
