# JavaScript - ES2015 Features

-----

Est. to complete: 4h

## Goal
- You have demonstrated the basic foundations in ES2015 (ES6) Features
- You should know about ES2015 polyfills, transpilers, compatibility tables, arrow functions, classes, `let`, `const`, generators, etc.


-----

## Intro

>ES6 is a significant update to the language, and the first update to the language since ES5 was standardized in 2009. Implementation of these features in major JavaScript engines is underway now. - [Luke Hoban](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features)

In 2016, to code in anything older than ES2015 is to introduce technical debt you might have to clean up later. Plus, several problems are solved easier without libraries in ES2015 than they were in earlier ES5 JavaScript.

## Suggested Assignment(s)
Choose one:

1) Complete **at least** all of the problems labeled "easy" from [ES6 Katas](http://es6katas.org/) (this should be at least 20 currently). Save these solved files somewhere to prove later.

2) Study the essential ES2015 features using the study materials below, and demonstrate and discuss your findings:
- [ ] Arrows, Lexical this
- [ ] Default (callee-evaluated) parameter values
- [ ] Classes
- [ ] Template Strings
- [ ] Let, Const
- [ ] Iterators & For...Of
- [ ] Generators
- [ ] Modules
- [ ] Map, Set, WeakMap, WeakSet
