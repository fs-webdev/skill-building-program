# JavaScript - JavaScript Debugging

-----

Est. to complete: ~0.5h

## Goal
- You have demonstrated the basic foundations in JavaScript Debugging
- You should know about breakpoints, `debugger`, stepping through/into/over js code, `console`, etc in multiple browsers.


-----

## Intro

>You can't change what you can't measure.

If what is happening is unexpected, you are shooting in the dark without measurement. Learn to step through your JavaScript with a debugger, or stay in the twilight zone.
