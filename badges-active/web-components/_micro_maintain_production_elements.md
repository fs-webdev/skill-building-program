-----

Est. to complete: 2hrs

## Goals

- You have demonstrated foundational knowledge in contributing to and maintaining production elements on GitHub.
- You are prepared to contribute to and maintain shared or open source code

## Intro

> "In open source, we feel strongly that to really do something well, you have to get a lot of people involved." - Linus Torvalds

Shared code within a company and open source are similar in a lot of ways.  Whether your shared code is proprietary 
or open, you will need to work with other developers on the big picture.  

Do your homework, and work well with others. If you do that while maintaining others' web components or
 your own web components, you'll make good relationships and end up with better quality code.
