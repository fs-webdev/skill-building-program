## Intro

> “Testing is something we have taken seriously from day one and as a result it’s a big part of our development culture. If you’ve been on the fence about writing unit tests but haven’t dove in headfirst yet let me tell you why you should. You’ll save yourself a bunch of pain and work happier by writing unit tests. Happy programmers write better code. There’s no better medicine for a software product than a frequent dose of high quality code.” ― http://blog.hubstaff.com/why-you-should-write-unit-tests/
