- For your Pull Request to be accepted, we ask that you base your content off of the framework and templates provided, and that you keep your styling consistent with existing content. Also see: [How to make content](how-to-make-content.md)

- Use Title Case on Suggested Study Links, using markdown link syntax, including the sourcename, like: 
`- [Something Awesome About the New Stuff - Great Lakes Sources](http://something.org/something-awesome)`

- Try to keep all critical hyperlinks publicly available locations, since this public repo is meant to also be read by those outside our org.

- Try to keep all wording non-specific to our org, since the repo is meant to be open-source first, and used by those outside our org.
